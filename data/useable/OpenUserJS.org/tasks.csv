**NOTE**: It appears that Zren is using `.meta` to be the actual metadata block items and so any manipulation of these should be stored elsewhere just in case `collaborators`, etc. is ever used/supported in a metadata block... doubt it will based off of Anthony's prior responses but does make the code simpler to read.

Advantages:
* **Works** unlike simple-xss
* Lots of maintainers/contributors
* Smaller than simple-xss
* Correctly allows sanitizing text **first** then applying markdown
* Optional list is included for current defaults... this **can be removed** but I would feel safer matching it in case something comes down the line we don't like.
* Does filter out `javascript:` items just like xss

* The trailing space in the value **is intentional** and should be maintained... the reason will be trimmed on submission thus saving some typing

* Accessing the datalist should be accomplished by two single clicks *(currently one to focus and one to activate)* with a pointing device, pressing the space bar when nothing has been previously entered, and of course if you already know it just start typing the first part and it should filter the datalist.
* When possibly adding new values try to mirror them into whichever modal datalist with/without a plural value e.g. a repeat offender so usually that User will go away... this won't always be the case and it may eventually veer from this structure a bit.
* *Try not to abuse* a generic reason without elaborating e.g. like spamming.

* In case someone tries to access **any** of these .less files in dev/dbg add **all** to `.gitignore`. Finish coding shock. ;)
* Scoot/modify the comments in `oujs.less` file to indicate where things should usually go
* Create an ""unstaged"" area in `oujs-bootswatch.less` for unstaged/unincorporated CSS into the variables/mixin stream... e.g. move my fixes to the bottom. If we stick with bootstrap these should be added to the updates. Bootswatch may at some point twiddle with these values so putting at end forces them to happen with standard cascading in style sheets

* Some max line length of 100
* Remove some older code not currently implemented AFAIK
* Remove some dead code
* Fixed unneeded directory traversal TODO
* Added one WARNING in on near duplicate code in another file in the controllers folder
* Removed unneeded `nil` lib loading... as `helpers` is already there and `nil` isn't present in this file at all

**NOTES**
* This file really could use some trimming up with distribution across the project tree ... hopefully I got most of it
* The last function in this file is why `render` and `preRender` functions were chosen in this refactor and applied across the board with the controllers. :)

* Remove the patches I put in for this portion
* Create function for encoding similar to GH's... see helper `encoding`
* Using encodeURIComponent from #795
* Fix bug of Fork History showing ""slugged"" instead of native/raw
* Fix category reference bug... redirect was set to the Object itself and not one of its properties
* Fix some more missing object identifiers in modelParser.js ... not all are validated yet and some may still be missing for future proofing
* Remove and Add some more watchpoints
* Flip successful ""rating updated"" for Groups to debug mode and related in `./libs/modelParser.js` ... these are generating too much log traffic #430

**NOTES**
* [ ] Followup with DB migration to add `fork.utf` to existing forks otherwise they may not show up next to the bullet
* Leaving GH import alone as it still works so far ... however a watchpoint added... GH web UI always `encodeURIComponent` just about everything... will need to reaffirm existing `encodeURI` later
* The term uri is inclusive to urls as previously described in #819 ... however in this context url means it could be partially encoded whereas uri means it absolutely is encoded... except for the slashes... normally those are encoded but we don't want them encoded... again following GH example. A url containing `ä` may be just that however a uri has `%E4`. You will notice that I renamed some of our identifiers from `url` to `uri`... this is on purpose to indicate that is what we are expecting.
* *express* `redirect()` uses [`Location`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30) and [`Content-Location`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.14) headers. This requires all urls to be at least URI encoded as per specs... e.g. all the browsers are adding in an `escape` for the section symbol *which may be an issue with them*. So hence why the naming of `url` vs `uri`.
* The base issue of readability of the code is still there... but at least this punches out some of the bugs mentioned.
* Compression/optimization hasn't occurred yet
* No DB migration is necessary now... this includes fixing `Re:` linkage
* The smarter encoder isn't finished yet as I may be rearranging this a bit but...

**This should knock out the BLOCKING label I put on**... at least from my perspective.

This appear to do exactly what we are looking for without the extra baggage. A little newer to the mix and not semver major yet... but seems stabler. Thanks to and welcome ""the new kid on the block"".

Threw a couple of real IPv6 addresses into the mix and it returned appropriate values:

``` js
ipRangeCheck(

  ['192.30.252.0/22', '185.199.108.0/22', '140.82.112.0/20']
) // Should return `false` and does

ipRangeCheck(

If we absolutely must... we can go back to re's... but I'd rather not at this time.

* https://github.com/jdesboeufs/connect-mongo/blob/9f86f90/README.md#remove-expired-sessions

NOTES:
These versions of the docs are ambiguous. The TTL is how often it reaches out to the DB... if it finds an expired session **or** a session cookie it will then remove it. So the inversion of the logic should fix this as it checks every 10ish minutes for expiry as well as session cookies and destroys them. Had a light bulb flip on with `interval` being doc'd at 10 minutes so I thought to try TTL at that... and voila. :)

This theoretically should solve #604 by sticking to this methodology *(until MongoDB changes something heh)*

When available will do some code condensing to reuse some more code if applicable.

* Remove *fakes3* dep and all associated Ruby/Rails for pure JavaScript implementation
* New dev dep *S3rver* handles what we need with basic i/o for S3 on dev. Please read their homepage
* Leaving *fakeS3* `.gitignore`'s in for current data path... please delete your copies as this should eventually go away... or you can manually migrate it yourself perhaps. I'll just reimport from GH the sources on dev which is a better use of my time.
* Fix a potential `undefined` I put in trap a while back with a generic string.
* Change all docs to accommodate this
* Moved a native dependency up top (the TODO)... code style conformance
* DELETE OP RETESTED... PASS

NOTE:
* Contributors, and up, should no longer need to launch the server as it's launched in dev automatically and should terminate with a SIGINT (app exit). Remote local hosts still supported although I've never used that myself.

* Remove flag UI notice if not able to... this should be in line with comments so they don't accidently/purposely get turned on without establishing owner approval. Modal is still output because of a logic error in what comes first versus the view... probably in the controller as a post op outside of `modelParser`... omitting for now.
* Change text for PP as it may not be safe in other countries. Never liked the stock PP text in the first place.
* Rework some icons... form values can't accept static HTML so stripping it out and placing in modal titlebar

* These are mostly comments in this PR
* Normalized a few more identifiers to their standards for easier grep'ing. I'm sure there's more.
* Some of these may be silent as intended... they should be denoted as such... like `fallthrough` for `switch` should be normally
* Some of these assume that AWS S3 and MongoLabs are perfectly connected and no issues... bad idea. This is what I was describing. We need [#37](Graceful failure) whether it's a comment, a console message, a page, or some combination of these.
* This doesn't include MongoDB calls that just use `save()` for example... which is not recommended at all. Error traps are good when connecting to third parties whether they are local or remote. I'm not perfect either but I can get easily burned out on fixing these which is why I work in stages instead of all at once. Don't get paid for that! ;) :) Always fill out the arguments if known especially with `aErr`. That's a reason why it's done first in this coding style.
* This was a very brief skim over the code... hopefully it wasn't overzealous or underzealous in code points... but they are comments to be addressed eventually. Living on four hours of sleep in 3 days isn't good so I'm taking a break not to mention a few days away from holiday days.

* This is very close to production version but since it is shared it's a crap shoot when creating a sandboxed *(free but limited btw)* DB. Interesting feature of mLabs. May try again to see if we can match it. First creation wasn't close enough; 2nd time it is close.

NOTES:
* Will leave old dev db up for a bit until full retesting occurs. Basic seems to be okay with new dev db.
* The FQDN name has changed for dev mLabs at some point in history. Probably offloaded onto a different server is an educated guess via DNS.
* pwd has to be at least 6 characters and include alphanumerics now... making as general as possible
* Can only import exported collections from here. Full DB import from export isn't happy which is okay as long as metadata `_since` is preserved. Probably has to do with db name conflict and mLabs.
* Metadata `_since` is preserved however it did complain about indexes on one collection:

``` console

Specification: { background: true, safe: null, name: ""name_1"", ns: ""openuserjs_devel.scripts"", key: { name: 1 } }
```

* 12 system indexes in new vs old which had 17. From v1 to v2. db name auto-adjusted.
* nodejitsu user index item not inclusive. Talk about a blast from the past.
*  Some misc indexes that I'm not sure why they are there were not auto-imported.
* Btw we are Eastern served... so not quite sure why the traceroute tests were going West other than general internet misdirection at this time in the backbones.
* Btw if we take this info to the VPS we may lose the dev db and probably need to establish additional limited sub-accounts

* *async*@3.x migration
* Using a more applicable statusCodePage for DB S3 connection issue... the error message is still rather vague since it's abstracted several times between function calls but was tested and landed on 404 during *fakeS3* usage. At some point when all callback signatures can be set to `aErr`, `aResults` this should be more explicit... until then preserving existing vagueness.
* Revert #1599 as Fx still uses this in 68.x. TLSv1 EOL will still prevent Opera Presto from even visiting the site.

NOTES:
* Apparently version 3.x migration is extremely picky now about how Err is generated. i.e. it doesn't allow `true`/`false` anymore like it did in version 2.x. This causes the request to never complete with `async.parallel`. The web spinner and no source is retrieved even though **it was successfully retrieved**.
* Been probing/testing dev manually and it seems to be non-sluggish atm with Fx 68.x... perhaps a change from 3.0 to 3.1 of this dep... or even Chromium report since distro version is/was a bit buggy at the time of testing.
